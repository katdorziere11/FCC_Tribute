                Naruto is a Japanese manga series written and illustrated by
                Masashi Kishimoto. It tells the story of Naruto Uzumaki, a young
                ninja who seeks recognition from his peers and dreams of
                becoming the Hokage, the leader of his village. The story is
                told in two parts â€“ the first set in Naruto's pre-teen years,
                and the second in his teens.

                <h3>Naruto</h3>
                Naruto is an orphan who seeks the approval of his village that
                has shunned him his whole life. He finds out that the demon fox
                spirit that destroyed the village 12 years prior was sealed
                inside of him as a baby. This is why people shun and fear him.
                Naruto becomes a ninja and vows to become the greatest, most
                powerful shinobi that his village has ever seen so that they
                will have to respect him.
                <h3>Naruto Shippuden</h3>
                Naruto Shippuden is the second series of Naruto anime that
                follows the titular hero on his quest to become Hokage. Unlike
                the first series, Naruto is now older and has new teachers to
                help him through his adventure. At the same time, he faces the
                biggest threats to the five shinobi nations and must deal with
                the loss of someone he considers a brother.
